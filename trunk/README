PHP-Qt - an extension for PHP5 that aims to write software with the Qt Toolkit.
================================================================================

PHP-Qt is an extension for PHP5 that aims to write software with the Qt Toolkit. 
It provides an object-oriented interface to the Qt4 Framework and allowes 
to write Qt applications in the PHP language.

Requirements
============

PHP-Qt requires PHP 5.1 or greater, the Qt4 header files and CMake.

PHP5: You should have a the header files and the development scripts.
Qt4: You should have the header files.

Note: at this time compilation is only tested in a Unix environment.

Compiling and installation
==========================

short:

cmake /path/to/php_qt
make
make install

more detailed:

You have cmake installed and the path to your PHP5 header files. After 
downloading or checking out from SVN the easiest way is to create a build 
directory in your copy of PHP-Qt. The extension will be built out-of-source 
which allows you to have a clean copy of PHP-Qt without any files of the build 
system.

PHP-Qt will be compiled as module! 

At first it is neccessary to create your build environment for compiling.
To do that just change into the 'php_qt/build' directory and run cmake:

cmake ..

You can give arguments to cmake via the -D option:
  -DQT_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/lib/qt4/include \
  -DQT_LIBRARY_DIR=/usr/lib/qt4

If no argument is given cmake will try to find the Qt4 and PHP5 files in the default or standard 
pathes as /usr/include, /usr/local/include etc.

Finally, run 

make

to build the extension. If the compilation is successful run 

make install

to copy 'php_qt.so' into php's extension directory. If it fails please check if you have 
permissions and all related pathes on your system are correct.

To remove old objectfiles run 

make clean

To test it, simply run one of the test scripts in the php_qt/test/ subdirectory.
To get a clean build system just remove all files in the build/ directory.
