PHP-Qt - an extension for PHP5 that enables the writing of PHP software using 
the Qt Toolkit.
================================================================================

PHP-Qt is an extension for PHP5 that provides an object-oriented interface to 
the Qt4 Framework and allows 
one to write Qt applications in the PHP language.

Requirements
============

PHP 5.1 or greater
PHP header files and the development scripts
(package may be called php-devel)

Qt4 header files
(package may be called qt4-devel)

CMake

Note: at this time compilation has only been tested in a Unix environment.

Compiling and installation
==========================

Both of these methods will compile and install PHP-Qt as a module.

The quick and easy way:

cmake /path/to/php_qt
make
make install


The more detailed way:

First make sure CMake, your PHP header files, and your Qt header files are 
installed.
Then, get PHP-Qt either by downloading or checking out from SVN and placing it 
into
its own directory.

Next it is neccessary to create your build environment for compiling.
To do this, just change into the directory where you placed PHP-Qt and run 
cmake:

cmake

If needed you can give arguments to CMake via the -D option, such as:
  -DQT_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/lib/qt4/include
  -DQT_LIBRARY_DIR=/usr/lib/qt4
  -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/usr/lib/qt4/bin/qmake
  
If no arguments are given, CMake will try to find the Qt4 and PHP5 files in 
the default or standard 
paths such as /usr/include, /usr/local/include etc.

Finally, run:

make

to build the extension. If the compilation is successful run:

make install

to copy 'php_qt.so' into php's extension directory. If it fails please check 
if you have 
permissions and all related paths on your system are correct.

To remove old objectfiles run:

make clean

To test it, simply run one of the test scripts in the php_qt/test/ 
subdirectory.

Troubleshooting
===================================

If you get the following error:
CMake Error: Could NOT find QtCore. Check CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log for more 
details.

Try running cmake as:
cmake /path/to/php-qt  -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/usr/lib/qt4/bin/qmake
(you may need to replace the /usr/lib/qt4/bin/qmake if yours is in another 
place)
