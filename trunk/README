PHP-Qt - an extension for PHP5 that aims to write software with the Qt Toolkit.
===============================================================================
PHP-Qt is an extension for PHP5 that aims to write software with the Qt Toolkit. 
It provides an object-oriented interface to the Qt4 Framework and allowes 
to write Qt applications in the PHP language.

Requirements
============

PHP-Qt requires PHP 5.1RC1 or greater and Qt4 header files.

PHP5: You should have a the header files and the development scripts.
Qt4: You should have the header files.

Note: at this time it is only possible to compile it in a unix envireonment.

Compiling and installation
==========================

After unpacking or checking out from SVN copy the php_qt directory into the 
php-5.1xxx/ext/ directory.

We prefer to build PHP-Qt as module!

At first it is neccessary to check your environment for compiling. 
To do that change into this directory and run configure:

./configure --enable-php_qt

If you have two or more php installations you can specify the path with

--with-prefix=/path/to/php5

To remove old objectfiles run 

make clean

Finally, run 

make

to build the extension. If the compilation is successful run 

make install

to copy 'php_qt.so' into php's extension directory.

To test it, simply run one of the test scripts in the php_qt/test/ subdirectory.
