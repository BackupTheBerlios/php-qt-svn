PHP-Qt - an extension for PHP5 that aims to write software with the Qt Toolkit.
===============================================================================
PHP-Qt is an extension for PHP5 that aims to write software with the Qt Toolkit. 
It provides an object-oriented interface to the Qt4 Framework and allowes 
to write Qt applications in the PHP language.

Requirements
============

PHP-Qt requires PHP 5.1RC1 or greater and Qt4 header files.

PHP5: You should have a the header files and the development scripts.
Qt4: You should have the header files.

Note: at this time it is only possible to compile it in a unix envireonment.

Compiling and installation
==========================

After unpacking or checking out from SVN copy the unpacked php_qt directory into the 
php-5.1xxx/ext/ directory.

We prefer to build PHP-Qt as module! In this example php is installed in /usr/local/

At first it is neccessary to check your environment for compiling. 
To do that change into this directory and run phpize and configure:

/usr/local/bin/phpize

./configure --with-php_qt[=/usr/lib/qt4/include] 		\
  --with-qtlib=/usr/lib/qt4 							\
  --with-php-config=/usr/local/php511/bin/php-config	\

The arguments in brackets are optional but may be necessary on your system.

To remove old objectfiles run 

make clean

Finally, run 

make

to build the extension. If the compilation is successful run 

make install

to copy 'php_qt.so' into php's extension directory.

To test it, simply run one of the test scripts in the php_qt/test/ subdirectory.
