PHP-Qt - an extension for PHP5 that aims to write software with the Qt Toolkit.
===============================================================================
PHP-Qt is an extension for PHP5 that aims to write software with the Qt Toolkit. 
It provides an object-oriented interface to the Qt4 Framework and allowes 
to write Qt applications in the PHP language.

Requirements
============

PHP-Qt requires PHP 5.1RC1 or greater and Qt4 header files.

PHP5: You should have a the header files and the development scripts.
Qt4: You should have the header files.

Note: at this time it is only possible to compile it in a unix environment.

Compiling and installation
==========================

You have a php-5.1.xxx build directory where you have compiled php. You also 
have a copy of php_qt. After downloading or checking out from SVN copy the 
unpacked php_qt directory into the php-5.1xxx/ext/ directory.

We prefer to build PHP-Qt as module! In this example php is 
installed in /usr/local/php511

At first it is neccessary to check your environment for compiling. 
To do that change into the php-5.1xxx/ext/php_qt directory and run phpize, kdeize.sh
and configure:

/usr/local/php511/bin/phpize

./kdeize.sh

./configure \
  --enable-php_qt \
  --with-qt-includes=/usr/lib/qt4/include \
  --with-qt-libraries=/usr/lib/qt4 \
  --with-php-config=/usr/local/php511/bin/php-config \

If --with-qt-includes and --with-qt-config are omitted, configure will try to find files in default or standard pathes

To remove old objectfiles run 

make clean

Finally, run 

make

to build the extension. If the compilation is successful run 

make install

to copy 'php_qt.so' into php's extension directory. If it fails please check 
all related pathes on your system at first.

To test it, simply run one of the test scripts in the php_qt/test/ subdirectory.
